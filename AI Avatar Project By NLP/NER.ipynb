day chill was murdered... i said terrible things. wayne true things. you made me see that justice is about more than my own pain and anger. rachel well, you proved me wrong. wayne about what rachel your father would be proud of you. just as i am. wayne looks at her, emotion rising. he takes rachel in his arms and they kiss, passionately... desperately. they break, wayne looks into rachels eyes, hopeful. but she gently shakes her head. rachel contd soft between batman and bruce wayne, theres no room for me. wayne rachel, this life i chose... i can give it up. rachel reaches up to his face with her hand. rachel you didnt choose the life, bruce. it was thrust upon you, the way greatness often is. youve given this city hope now shes depending on you. we all are. wayne looks at her.

taps the stencil. batman nice. continued continued 2 147. gordon crushing his cup couldnt find any mob bosses to strap to the light. gordon kills the searchlight. the two men stand opposite each other in the dark. batman well, sergeant gordon its lieutenant , now. commissioner loeb had to promote me. and he had to disband the task force hunting you. amazing what saving a city can do for your image. batman then things are better. gordon nods youve started something bent cops running scared, hope on the streets... gordon leaves his sentence hanging between them. batman but gordon but theres a lot of weirdness out there right now... the narrows is lost ... we still havent picked up crane or half the inmates of arkham that he freed... batman we will. gotham will return to normal. gordon will it what about escalation batman escalation gordon westart carrying semiautomatics, they buy automatics... westart wearing kevlar, they buy armorpiercing rounds... continued continued 3 148. batman and

evidence bag. gordon contd ...armed robbery, double homicide... inside the clear plastic bag is a playing card. gordon contd got a taste for theatrics, like you... gordon hands batman the bag. gordon contd leaves a calling card. batman turns the card over. it is a joker. batman ill look into it. he steps up onto the balustrade. gordon looks at him. gordon i never said thank you. batman looks out at the lights of gotham. cloak billowing around him. batman and youll never have to. batman drops from the rooftop, gliding on the night wind. gordon smiles. he cant help it. fade out continued
